sales data was cleaned, relationships were established, and visualizations such as a tree map for sales distribution and a bar chart for category-wise item sales were created.

Case 2: Intermediate Customer & Sales Insights involved integrating customer data, calculating Average Revenue Per Buyer (ARPB) using DAX, and visualizing trends through bar charts, pie charts, and line charts. Additionally, sales campaign suggestions were provided based on purchasing behavior.

For Case 3: Advanced Delivery & Stock Analysis, a Delivery Status column was added, stock levels were categorized using a DAX Switch formula, and insights were visualized through bar charts, scatter plots, and conditional formatting in tables. Recommendations for improving logistics and stock management were also provided.
